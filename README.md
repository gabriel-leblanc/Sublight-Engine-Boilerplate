## Figma
Figma is a platform where we had a template of a website to reproduce. The challenge was to begin with the big scheme and also begin with little pieces. The first step I did was to create the general layout, and then inside each section of the HTML site I placed little objects, and organizes my code around these. 

I had to be careful with the flex display; if a flex is inside another flex, things can get wrong quick. 

After that, it was some fine tuning scaling all the font-sizes, all the margins and fields. 

## Mobile display
I added 3 media breakpoints, so there's 4 in total. The breakpoints are there to adapt the display in fonction of the screen size.
